# Deforestation induced habitat fragmentation analysis
Analysing habitat fragmentation and deforestation in a small study area in San Javier, Bolivia.

## Context
Tropical deforestation has been a major driver of carbon emission and biodiversity loss due to habitat fragmentation. Large mammal species that once roamed freely across a wide landscape are now pressured into living in smaller and smaller areas. The key habitat of the new worldâ€™s largest wildcat, the jaguar (Panthera onca) spans across the tropical forests of Bolivia. They are currently classified as near threatened due to intensive agricultural activities, urbanisation and illegal hunting.
## Objective(s)
Habitat fragmentation heightens species' vulnerability and triggers various negative consequences. This has immensely contributed to the near-threatened status of jaguars across South America.
Therefore, we aimed to 1) measure the annual forest degradation between 2005 and 2020 in San Javier, Bolivia using satellite images. Then, 2) assess various landscape metrics to provide insight into the deteriorating habitat quality for jaguars and large mammals alike.
## Study area
San Javier, situated in the department of Beni, is a municipality with approximately 3000 residents. Spanning an area of 10,000 square kilometers, it is bordered to the west by the Rio Mamore river and encompasses numerous freshwater bodies and few built-up areas. The pie chart represents the land cover as it was in 2010 (Globcover dataset).

The municipality has undergone extensive cattle ranching and mechanized agriculture activities, which are causing degradation in both the surrounding areas and within Pedro Ignacio Muiba, a regional park.
## Data sources
Landsat is the longest running Earth observation mission that is maintained by NASA and the United States geological survey department. The multispectral resolution of Landsat satellites is sufficient to compute vegetation indices and perform classification algorithms at 30-m resolution to differentiate between forested and non-forested areas. For the creation of training data, we used the 2009 Globcover dataset to understand the type of landcover that exist. For validation of forest deforestation, we used the Global Forest Change dataset.
